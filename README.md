# FruitPunch AI Code epoch 4: Machine learning on a Microcontroller

AI Code is an initiative by fruitpunch where students can learn to apply AI together by solving a challenge under supervision of an expert. This repository contains the challenge files for epoch 4.

## Challenge description
Machine learning is getting increasingly popular among devices on the edge, namely in IoT. In this challenge we are going to build a machine learning model that will run on small, battery-powered devices to detect trigger words just like “Ok, Google” or “Alexa” in home assistants.


For this challenge we're having a guest lecturer: Mehmet Ali Anil from Grus BV.
He is going to guide you through [this](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/sparkfun-tensorflow/) walkthrough.

Since this is such a different challenge we understand there might be questions afterwards.
You can contact Mehmet through mehmet@grusbv.com.
